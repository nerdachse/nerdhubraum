Or: A nerdy way to learn Rust on stream

Nerdhubraum is meant to be an useful experiment to learn (or improve at) Rust coding and even moreso teaching concepts.
The idea is to build a platform that summarizes different metrics of my twitch streaming like e.g. the list of followers.

It's also a building block for self-made overlays and alerts, written in Rust and compiled to Webassembly
